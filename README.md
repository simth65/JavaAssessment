# JavaAssessment
Reflect on the following questions in your readme file
What did you like about this project?
I like the idea that a 2 dimensional array being made into a game. Kind of interesting and fun! I have always wanted to develop my own game some day.

What did you struggle with in this project?
I don't find this project difficult. Completed it within 3.5 hrs with about 45 mins to spare. Decided to spend more time to add in more function and features since the project time is extended till the next day 9 am. Added feature to allow user to select from 3 different preset grid sizes. User can also select the "difficulty" level, this will increase the number of HOLE inserted into the game board as obstacles. Unfortunately as the difficulty level increases, there is also a chance that there will be no valid path between the player and the heart. More intelligence can be built into this game to make sure that there is at least 1 path between the player and the heart.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I enjoy working on challenging software development. I enjoy the process of learning new tricks/short-cuts to get things done.

# JavaAssessment
Reflect on the following questions in your readme file
What did you like about this project?
I like the idea that a 2 dimensional array is made into a game. Kind of interesting and fun! I have always wanted to develop my own game some day.

What did you struggle with in this project?
I don't find this project difficult. Completed it within 3.5 hrs with about 45 mins to spare. Decided to spend more time to add in more function and features since the project time is extended till the next day 9 am. Added feature to allow user to select from 3 different preset grid sizes. User can also select the "difficulty" level, this will increase the number of HOLE inserted into the game board as obstacles.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I enjoy doing software development, the more complicated the requirement, the more I will enjoy working on it.
